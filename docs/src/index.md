# Package

The **Workshop Wizard** is a magical little helper who will download and
install one of [my](https://github.com/crstnbr) Julia workshops
(like [this one](https://github.com/crstnbr/JuliaWorkshop19)) for you.

Specifically, the wizard does the following:

* Download the workshop materials
* Instantiate and precompile the workshop environment
* Add IJulia to the global environment (opt-out possible)
